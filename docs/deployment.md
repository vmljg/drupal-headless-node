# Deployment Guide

This comprehensive deployment guide covers the process of deploying the headless Drupal, Platformatic PHP-Node, and Next.js application stack to production environments. The deployment process involves configuring each component for production use, implementing security measures, optimizing performance, and establishing monitoring and maintenance procedures.

## Production Architecture Overview

The production architecture differs significantly from the development setup, emphasizing security, scalability, and reliability. The production environment typically consists of multiple servers or containers, each optimized for specific roles within the application stack.

The recommended production architecture includes a load balancer for distributing traffic, separate application servers for the Platformatic bridge and Next.js frontend, a dedicated database server with backup and replication capabilities, and a Redis cluster for caching and session management. This separation of concerns allows for independent scaling of each component based on demand and resource requirements.

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Server Specifications

Production deployment requires adequate server resources to handle expected traffic loads and provide room for growth. The minimum recommended specifications include 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, and 100GB SSD storage for each application server. Database servers should have additional resources, with 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and high-performance storage with RAID configuration for data protection.

Network connectivity should provide sufficient bandwidth for expected traffic, with redundant connections to ensure availability. Consider using content delivery networks (CDN) for static assets to reduce server load and improve global performance.

### Operating System Configuration

Use a stable, long-term support Linux distribution such as Ubuntu LTS or CentOS for production servers. Keep the operating system updated with security patches and configure automatic security updates where appropriate.

Configure firewalls to restrict access to only necessary ports and services. Implement fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention systems to protect against brute force attacks and automated threats.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all communications between clients and servers, as well as between internal services. Use certificates from a trusted certificate authority or implement Let's Encrypt for automated certificate management.

Configure strong cipher suites and disable deprecated protocols to ensure secure communications. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.

## Database Deployment

### Production Database Setup
